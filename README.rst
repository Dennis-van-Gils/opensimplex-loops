OpenSimplex Loops
=================

This library provides higher-level functions that can generate seamlessly-looping
animated images and closed curves, and seamlessy-tileable images. It relies on 4D
OpenSimplex noise, which is a type of
`gradient noise <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_noise>`_ that features
spatial coherence.

- Github: https://github.com/Dennis-van-Gils/opensimplex-loops
- PyPI: https://pypi.org/project/opensimplex-loops

This library is an extension to the
`OpenSimplex Python library by lmas <https://github.com/lmas/opensimplex>`_.

Installation
============

::

    pip install opensimplex-loops

This will install the following dependencies:

- ``opensimplex``
- ``numpy``
- ``numba``
- ``numba-progress``

Notes:

- The `OpenSimplex` library by lmas does not enforce the use of the
  `numba <https://numba.pydata.org/>`_ package, but is left optional instead.
  Here, I have set it as a requirement due to the heavy computation required
  by these highler-level functions. I have them optimized for `numba` which
  enables multi-core parallel processing within Python, resulting in major
  speed improvements compared to as running without. I have gotten computational
  speedups by a factor of ~200.

- Note that the very first call of each of these OpenSimplex functions will take
  a longer time than later calls. This is because `numba` needs to compile this
  Python code to bytecode specific to your platform, once.

- The ``numba-progress`` package is actually optional. When present, a progress
  bar will be shown during the noise generation.


API
===

``looping_animated_2D_image(...)``
----------------------------------

    Generates a stack of seamlessly-looping animated 2D raster images drawn
    from 4D OpenSimplex noise.

    The first two OpenSimplex dimensions are used to describe a plane that gets
    projected onto a 2D raster image. The last two dimensions are used to
    describe a circle in time.

    Args:
        N_frames (`int`, default = 200)
            Number of time frames

        N_pixels_x (`int`, default = 1000)
            Number of pixels on the x-axis

        N_pixels_y (`int` | `None`, default = `None`)
            Number of pixels on the y-axis. When set to None `N_pixels_y` will
            be set equal to `N_pixels_x`.

        t_step (`float`, default = 0.1)
            Time step

        x_step (`float`, default = 0.01)
            Spatial step in the x-direction

        y_step (`float` | `None`, default = `None`)
            Spatial step in the y-direction. When set to None `y_step` will be
            set equal to `x_step`.

        dtype (`type`, default = `numpy.double`)
            Return type of the noise array elements. To reduce the memory
            footprint one can change from the default `numpy.double` to e.g.
            `numpy.float32`.

        seed (`int`, default = 3)
            Seed value for the OpenSimplex noise

        verbose (`bool`, default = `True`)
            Print 'Generating noise...' to the terminal? If the `numba_progress`
            package is present a progress bar will also be shown.

    Returns:
        The 2D image stack as 3D array [time, y-pixel, x-pixel] containing the
        OpenSimplex noise values as floating points. The output is garantueed to
        be in the range [-1, 1], but the exact extrema cannot be known a-priori
        and are probably quite smaller than [-1, 1].

``looping_animated_closed_1D_curve(...)``
-----------------------------------------

    Generates a stack of seamlessly-looping animated 1D curves, each curve in
    turn also closing up seamlessly back-to-front, drawn from 4D OpenSimplex
    noise.

    The first two OpenSimplex dimensions are used to describe a circle that gets
    projected onto a 1D curve. The last two dimensions are used to describe a
    circle in time.

    Args:
        N_frames (`int`, default = 200)
            Number of time frames

        N_pixels_x (`int`, default = 1000)
            Number of pixels of the curve

        t_step (`float`, default = 0.1)
            Time step

        x_step (`float`, default = 0.01)
            Spatial step in the x-direction

        dtype (`type`, default = `numpy.double`)
            Return type of the noise array elements. To reduce the memory
            footprint one can change from the default `numpy.double` to e.g.
            `numpy.float32`.

        seed (`int`, default = 3)
            Seed value for the OpenSimplex noise

        verbose (`bool`, default = `True`)
            Print 'Generating noise...' to the terminal? If the `numba_progress`
            package is present a progress bar will also be shown.

    Returns:
        The 1D curve stack as 2D array [time, x-pixel] containing the
        OpenSimplex noise values as floating points. The output is garantueed to
        be in the range [-1, 1], but the exact extrema cannot be known a-priori
        and are probably quite smaller than [-1, 1].

``tileable_2D_image(...)``
--------------------------

    noise.

    The first two OpenSimplex dimensions are used to describe a circle that gets

    are used to describe another circle that gets projected onto the y-axis of
    the 2D raster image.

            Seed value for the OpenSimplex noise

        verbose (`bool`, default = `True`)
            Print 'Generating noise...' to the terminal? If the `numba_progress`
            package is present a progress bar will also be shown.

    Returns:
        The 2D image as 2D array [y-pixel, x-pixel] containing the
